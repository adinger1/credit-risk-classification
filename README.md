# credit-risk-classification

The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether this model would be helpful for predicting the likelihood of returns on loans.

This model produced an accuracy score of 0.99, meaning that it was able to correctly predict the status (healthy or high-risk) of the overwhelming majority of the loans.
The model correctly determined all healthy loans (precision rate 100%) and was able to correctly identify 85% of the high-risk loans. 
The model also produced a recall rate of 99% for healthy loans and 91% for high-risk loans. 
In other words, out of all the actual healthy loans, the model was able to correctly classify 99% of them, and out of all the true high-risk loans, the model was able to classify 91% of them.

Overall, this model will be incredibly useful for classifying both healthy loans and potentially high-risk loans.
